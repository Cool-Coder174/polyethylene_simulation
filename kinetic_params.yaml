# --- Kinetic Rate Constants for the Sargin & Beckman (2020) Model ---
# This file defines the rate constants (k1-k8) used in the system of ordinary
# differential equations (ODEs) that model the chemical kinetics of polyethylene
# degradation. These constants are crucial for determining the speed and direction
# of various reactions, including radical formation, oxygen consumption,
# crosslinking, and chain scission.
# Units are a mix of (L/mol/s) and (1/s), depending on the reaction order.

rate_constants:
  k1: 2.0e7      # Rate constant for the initiation reaction (PE + O2 -> PE•)
  k2: 1.0e8      # Rate constant for the propagation reaction (PE• + O2 -> PEOO•)
  k3: 1.0e6      # Rate constant for hydrogen abstraction (PEOO• + PE -> PEOOH + PE•)
  k4: 1.0e7      # Rate constant for termination by combination (PE• + PE• -> PEOOPE, Crosslinking)
  k5: 1.0e-4     # Rate constant for hydroperoxide decomposition (PEOOH -> PE• + •OH, leading to Scission)
  k6: 1.0e8      # Rate constant for termination by disproportionation (PEOO• + PEOO• -> PEOOPE + O2)
  k7: 1.0e7      # Rate constant for cross-termination (PEOO• + PE• -> PEOOPE)
  k8: 1.0e8      # Rate constant for chain transfer (PE• + PEOOH -> PE + PEOO•)
