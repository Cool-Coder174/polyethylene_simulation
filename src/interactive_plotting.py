    """
    Generates and saves interactive HTML plots for chemical kinetics data
    from a specific simulation run.

    This function creates two types of plots:
    1. Average Chemical Species Concentration vs. Time: Shows how the average
       concentrations of different chemical species change over the simulation's
       time steps.
    2. Relative Rates of Crosslinking vs. Scission: Illustrates the change
       in crosslinking and scission product concentrations over time, giving
       an indication of their relative reaction rates.

    The plots are saved as HTML files in the specified output directory,
    allowing for interactive exploration in a web browser.

    Args:
        db_path (Path): The absolute path to the SQLite database file.
        output_dir (Path): The directory where the generated HTML plots will be saved.
